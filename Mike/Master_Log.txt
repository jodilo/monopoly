March 21 2013
3:40 p.m.

To Do:
	Begin work on player class while considering how it will interact with other classes, implement functions as best as possible
	without graphics.

March 21 2013
4:20 p.m.

Done:
	Almost completed player class (for now), still need to think of way for trades to be proposed to other players.

Time Spent: 40 min
Total Time: 40 min

March 24 2013
10:33 p.m.

To Do:
	Continue to develop player class created in lab, begin work on board and tile classes. Decide upon structure of board and tile,
	as to whether or not tile will inherit from board.

March 25 2013
12:49 a.m.

Done: 
	Finished player class barring any errors once it is compiled. Created board class with an array of tiles, decided not to have
	tiles inherit from board. Began work on tile interface.

Time Spent: 2 hr, 16 min
Total Time: 2 hr, 56 min

March 25 2013
11:17 p.m.

To Do:
	Develop board, tile and possibly an inherited property class. Also create driver program and makefile that creates an instance
	of each of these classes to some degree and prints out a message as prescribed by the rubric.

March 26 2013
2:44 a.m.

Done: 
	Player, Board, Tile, and Tile's inherited Property class all created and compile. Driver program also created in addition to 
	makefile. When made and run, driver program (./main) creates a player, board, and the first two tiles of the board. The first
	tile is of object type Tile, and the second is of object type Property. Once created the program prints out a message saying
	what was created.

Time Spent: 3 hr, 27 min
Total Time: 6 hr, 23 min

April 2 2013 
11:32 p.m.

To Do:
	Begin developing a game class that asks for number of players, and then for each player's name. In addition, develop a method of
	"rolling dice" to determine how far the player will go on the board each turn.

April 3 2013
2:24 a.m.

Done:
	Tester program makes a game and correctly reads in players. Players then have dice rolled for them and the program prints out their
	previous board location and the new board location.

Time Spent: 2hr, 52 min
Total Time: 9 hr, 15 min

April 4 2013
2:10 p.m.

To Do:
	Update player's ability to move around the board and go from end of board to front properly, and receive 200 dollars for passing GO.
	Also be able to go backwards

April 4 2013
3:02 p.m.

Done:
	Updated Game.cpp and Player.h and Player.cpp functions to allow player to travel around board properly.

Time Spent: 52 min
Total Time: 10 hr, 7 min

April 4 2013
3:21 p.m.

To Do:
	Continue filling in the board with proper information for each location.

April 4 2013
4:49 p.m.

Done:
	Filled board and began creating functions to have players interact with board. Also determined a "Utility" and "Jail" class are likely
	to be needed.

Time Spent: 1 hr, 28 min
Total Time: 11 hr, 35 min

April 7 2013
7:10 p.m.

To Do:
	Add on full interaction with the board as the player moves around the board, include messages printed out for each location and implement
	all classes required to make this happen.

April 8 2013
1:36 a.m.

Done:
	Each location on the board has a working interact function that prints information about the location for the user and allows the user
	to buy the location when possible. If location is bought, player's money is affected accordingly and later players to arrive at square
	lose money equal to the original cost of the the location (for now).

Time Spent: 6 hr 26 min
Total Time: 18 hr 1 min

April 8 2013
10:45 a.m.

To Do: 
	Make sure players are awarded money each time another player lands on one of their properties. Implement a rent data member for certain classes
	and a payBack function to give players this money.

April 8 2013
12:00 p.m.

Done:
	Money changes hands properly, although the rules for the value of rent is not 100% accurate as of right now.

Time Spent: 1 hr 15 min
Total Time: 19 hr 16 min

April 8 2013
1:35 p.m.

To Do:
	Implement a method of associating tiles by "color" (i.e. Pasquerilla East and Pasquerilla West, the 4 "railroads"...) and have rent for 'railroads' and 
	'utilities' change accordingly. In addition, use this method to determine which groups have the same owner and begin implementing the purchase of houses
	and hotels.

April 8 2013
4:51 p.m.

Done:
	Have a means to distinguish between groups of tiles, and now print out the names of the tiles you own at the start of your turn. Next is to recognize if a player owns
	an entire group of tiles and then give them the option to build a house or hotel on any of those locations.

Time Spent: 3 hr 16 min
Total Time: 22 hr 32 min

April 8 2013
10:14 p.m.

To Do:
	Implement a text display that informs the player which of their properties they can build houses or hotels on, gives them the option to do so and subtracts money 
	accordingly. Additionally, updates the rent of the property based on the construction done on the location.

April 9 2013
1:18 a.m.

Done:
	Houses and hotels can be purchased as follows: owning all properties in a group allows you to buy houses for those properties. Having four houses on one property
	allows you to buy a hotel for that property, which then removes the four houses. Working rules are in place for updating the rent for opposing players that land
	on an owned property. However, railroad's rent and utility's rent are not working 100% properly, and need some maintenance done on them.

Time Spent: 3 hr 4 min
Total Time: 25 hr 36 min

April 11 2013
3:15 p.m.

To Do:
	Find way to implement utility's moneyEffect values and fix rules for rent on properties based on how many houses or hotels are on the property.

April 11 2013
5:34 p.m.

Done:
	Utility, Jail all now work properly and moneyEffect has been successfully implemented. All that remains is SAO/SUB cards and trading

Time Spent: 2 hr 19 min
Total Time: 27 hr 55 min

April 16 2013
12:34 a.m.

To Do:
	Implement working decks of SAO and SUB cards that interact with the user and affect the player as they should. Also implement a system for players to trade at the
	beginning of their turn.

April 16 2013
5:17 a.m.

Done:
	SAO and SUB cards fully implemented, trading code has begun but is still very buggy. Error discovered to still exist in updating rent for railroads.

Time Spent: 4 hr 43 min
Total Time: 32 hr 38 min

April 18 2013
3:02 p.m.

To Do:
	Implement a system where if the player loses all of his or her money, they are eliminated from the game. In addition, make it so that if a purchase would eliminate
	the player from the game, the program does not present the purchase as an option for the user. Later this will be improved so that the player is given the option
	to mortgage property in order to stay in the game. Also need to present the 50 dollar buy out option to escape Res Life.

April 18 2013
4:04 p.m.

Done:
	Player cannot make purchases that would cause their eliminatation, player can be eliminated at 0 dollars. Player can also now buy their way out of Res Life for $50,
	only if they actually have the $50 to spend. Remaining features are trades and mortgaging.

Time Spent: 1 hr 2 min
Total Time: 33 hr 40 min

April 24 2013
8:05 p.m.

To Do:
	Implement mortgaging and trading fully, completing the logic for the monopoly game. Be sure that if a player is up to be eliminated the game checks to see if they own
	anything and then asks them to mortgage these properties.

April 24 2013
11:30 p.m.

Done:
	Implemented a mortgaging and trading system that compiles, was unable to fully test it due to an issue with an SDL command that prevented the entire program from compiling.

Time Spent: 3 hr 25 min
Total Time: 37 hr 05 min

April 30 2013
4:00 p.m.

To Do:
	Work with Kyle to fully implement my logic with the rest of the group's graphics, make the game fully functional in a graphical version. Do not
	leave Fitzpatrick until it is finished. Do not collect $200

May 1 2013
8:30 a.m.

Done:
	Graphical interface fully linked with logic, save for some interaction with build and mortgage functionality

Time Spent: 16 hr 30 min
Total Time: 53 hr 35 min

May 1 2013
9:00 p.m.

To Do:
	Putting finishing touches on game interactivity with logic, begin debugging all seg faults caused by "mislcicks"

May 2 2013
12:41 a.m.

Done:
	Fully implemented Jail and Building graphics, edited method of checking for group owned status to remove houses/hotels from properties that
	no longer have group ownership. This would come into play if a trade breaks up a monopoly.

Time Spent: 3 hr 41 min
Total Time: 57 hr 16 min

May 2 2013
7:14 p.m.

To Do:
	Help Kyle debug and smooth out final product of game, hopefully catch majority if not at all of bugs
