DISCLAIMER - ALL TOTAL TIME MEASURED ON THIS TIME LOG ARE EXCLUSIVE TO THE
TIMES RECORDED IN THIS TIME LOG (sorry, there's other scattered time logs
that were submitted into the lab_project)

MONDAY, APRIL 15

5:00 - Walk into the lab
7:00 - Loaded multiple player pieces into an array stored within 
	monopoly_board.cpp.  Rendered it so that multiple pieces can now move
	independently
9:00 - Unify the board display with monopoly logic - pieces now identify with
	a certain player
10:00 - Finalized the movements, fully integrating dice rolls with the 
	piece movement.  Piece movement now uses a massive switch statement
	to determine its proper location.

TOTAL TIME = 5 hours

TUESDAY APRIL 16
8:00 - begin group meeting
9:00 - end group meeting - discussed where we are heading, began laying
	down ground work for how to integrate drop-down menus into the
	display for monopoly

TOTAL TIME = 6 hours

THURSDAY APRIL 18
9:00 - Walk into the lab
10:30 - added robustness to the includes by changing source files to a sym
	link to Mike/ folder (where monopoly logic is housed). Edited Makefile
	to run in both the monopoly_board/ folder and the Mike/ folder, pulling
	all necessary .o files
11:30 - Still exploring ways to get the user inputs routed to the screen
12:30 - I did it - by passing the SDL &event reference through to board, you
	can run commands within monopoly functionality. Will begin to pass this 	functionality through to other places

TOTAL TIME = 9.5 hours

MONDAY APRIL 22
11:00 PM - walk into lab
11:30 - folded the SDL &event structure into its own class called SDL_logic
	This can now be included into all levels of the program, and we should
	be looking at a text command, board controlled version pretty shortly
2:30 AM - finished folding all of monopoly_board.cpp into it's own .cpp/.h
	files, complete with a new driver. Hopefully this will make it easier
	to pass reference to the board's surface, but if not then the code is
	still broken down into easier to understand pieces that are all more
	flexible
4:15 AM - My ideas weren't working - tried passing the entire monopoly_board
	object through to Game, but guess that won't fly. Did a git push 
	at the 2:30 though, so I checked out back to that and will look at
	this again soon

TOTAL TIME = 14.75 hours

MONDAY APRIL 29
8:00 PM - walk into the lab
10:00 PM - beginnings of image application from within Game working
10:30 PM - trying to restructure the interior format of the code
12:45 AM - That reformatting did not go well, kept having to clear my
directory as it got too convuluted.  Will proceed with current setup for now
1:08 AM - Property Cards applied to screen
2:11 AM - SAO and SUB cards beginning to point get on screen - some debugging
left
3:00 AM - SAO and SUB cards successfully located, added corner cards
3:30 AM - Retooled how tiles are bought
4:30 AM - continued reworking the logic of board, added more functionality to
	SDL_Logic
5:30 AM - view option is now up and running, took some time to code in the
	exact dimensions of the whitespace to cover up unowned tiles
	though. This creates a nice setup for trade functionality
5:45 AM - I gotta call it...still things to do, but it is time to sleep

TOTAL TIME: 25.5 hours

TUESDAY APRIL 30
4:00 PM - walk into lab
5:00 PM - debugged Railroad, Utility, and part of Jail with Mike, added more
	images to the screen display, debugged SAO and SUB
7:00 PM - Got trade up and running, continued work on view, and further
	resolved issues with SAO and SUB
8:00 PM - came back from dinner
11:00 PM - Mike and I further resolved visualizaition of pre and post roll,
	buying houses and hotels is now functioning and visible, fixed
	large bug in trading that caused pieces not to actually trade
	completely, other small bugs, began work with Jodi on revisualizing
	singles, doubles, triples, quads, and six man (vs. houses/hotels)
1:30 AM - resolved merge issue where two pushes were quite incompatible,
	presented a challenge in merging but we were able to organize
	everything properly
2:30 AM - Mortgage up and running, functional
3:30 AM - began work on linking in room designs, tile backs, and 
	discussed strategy for how do implement click design
