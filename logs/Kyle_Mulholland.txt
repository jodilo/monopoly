DISCLAIMER - ALL TOTAL TIME MEASURED ON THIS TIME LOG ARE EXCLUSIVE TO THE
TIMES RECORDED IN THIS TIME LOG (sorry, there's other scattered time logs
that were submitted into the lab_project)

MONDAY, APRIL 15

5:00 - Walk into the lab
7:00 - Loaded multiple player pieces into an array stored within 
	monopoly_board.cpp.  Rendered it so that multiple pieces can now move
	independently
9:00 - Unify the board display with monopoly logic - pieces now identify with
	a certain player
10:00 - Finalized the movements, fully integrating dice rolls with the 
	piece movement.  Piece movement now uses a massive switch statement
	to determine its proper location.

TOTAL TIME = 5 hours

TUESDAY APRIL 16
8:00 - begin group meeting
9:00 - end group meeting - discussed where we are heading, began laying
	down ground work for how to integrate drop-down menus into the
	display for monopoly

TOTAL TIME = 6 hours

THURSDAY APRIL 18
9:00 - Walk into the lab
10:30 - added robustness to the includes by changing source files to a sym
	link to Mike/ folder (where monopoly logic is housed). Edited Makefile
	to run in both the monopoly_board/ folder and the Mike/ folder, pulling
	all necessary .o files
11:30 - Still exploring ways to get the user inputs routed to the screen
12:30 - I did it - by passing the SDL &event reference through to board, you
	can run commands within monopoly functionality. Will begin to pass this 	functionality through to other places

TOTAL TIME = 9.5 hours

MONDAY APRIL 22
11:00 PM - walk into lab
11:30 - folded the SDL &event structure into its own class called SDL_logic
	This can now be included into all levels of the program, and we should
	be looking at a text command, board controlled version pretty shortly
2:30 AM - finished folding all of monopoly_board.cpp into it's own .cpp/.h
	files, complete with a new driver. Hopefully this will make it easier
	to pass reference to the board's surface, but if not then the code is
	still broken down into easier to understand pieces that are all more
	flexible
4:15 AM - My ideas weren't working - tried passing the entire monopoly_board
	object through to Game, but guess that won't fly. Did a git push 
	at the 2:30 though, so I checked out back to that and will look at
	this again soon

TOTAL TIME = 14.75 hours

MONDAY APRIL 29
8:00 PM - walk into the lab
10:00 PM - beginnings of image application from within Game working
10:30 PM - trying to restructure the interior format of the code
12:45 AM - That reformatting did not go well, kept having to clear my
directory as it got too convuluted.  Will proceed with current setup for now
1:08 AM - Property Cards applied to screen
2:11 AM - SAO and SUB cards beginning to point get on screen - some debugging
left
3:00 AM - SAO and SUB cards successfully located, added corner cards
3:30 AM - Retooled how tiles are bought
4:30 AM - continued reworking the logic of board, added more functionality to
	SDL_Logic
5:30 AM - view option is now up and running, took some time to code in the
	exact dimensions of the whitespace to cover up unowned tiles
	though. This creates a nice setup for trade functionality
5:45 AM - I gotta call it...still things to do, but it is time to sleep

TOTAL TIME: 25.5 hours

TUESDAY APRIL 30
4:00 PM - walk into lab
5:00 PM - debugged Railroad, Utility, and part of Jail with Mike, added more
	images to the screen display, debugged SAO and SUB
7:00 PM - Got trade up and running, continued work on view, and further
	resolved issues with SAO and SUB
8:00 PM - came back from dinner
11:00 PM - Mike and I further resolved visualizaition of pre and post roll,
	buying houses and hotels is now functioning and visible, fixed
	large bug in trading that caused pieces not to actually trade
	completely, other small bugs, began work with Jodi on revisualizing
	singles, doubles, triples, quads, and six man (vs. houses/hotels)
1:30 AM - resolved merge issue where two pushes were quite incompatible,
	presented a challenge in merging but we were able to organize
	everything properly
2:30 AM - Mortgage up and running, functional
3:30 AM - began work on linking in room designs, tile backs, and 
	discussed strategy for how do implement click design
5:45 AM - view has awesome functionality now, render prices on unsold
	properties, more functionality to SDL_logic
6:30 AM - finalized view - broke it into two functions to have more
	sensical and versital output
8:00 AM - trade is 100% complete - some nice Object Oriented
	Programming and incorporation of TTF functions
9:00 AM - Continuing work on getting Mortgage functional and visual - about
	halfway there, will continue later today. Over and out.

TOTAL TIME - 42.5 hours

TUESDAY MAY 1 continued:
4:30 - walk into lab
5:30 - mortgage is up and running
5:30 - left lab
8:30 - walk back into lab
12:30 - left lab again, made lots of edits across the board, did work with
	mortgaging, "Buy" images, start menu debugging, SDL_logic
	functionality, etc.

TOTAL TIME - 47.5 hours

WEDNESDAY MAY 2:
6:30 - walk into lab
7:00 - added dynamic string to print player name and money on the view
	screen
8:00 - Resolved color issues, tweaked image formatting, fixed major
	segfault bug when trying to view Railroad or Utility tiles
9:00 - Resolved issue where an SAO or SUB card that moves the piece
	somewhere else was not displaying both the SAO/SUB card and
	the tile that was the piece was relocated to.
9:30 - Build functionality expanded - options to build houses only
	allow you to click on the number of houses that are possible left
	to build (before, you could click on 1-4 and if that went over
	four houses then the code just assumed you wanted to build up
	to four houses.  Now, the buttons match the number of houses left
	to build and the logic functionality mirrors). Also updated the
	some imaging files. Worked with Mike to fix trading bugs.
10:15 - fixed bug where houses and for sale sign wouldn't show up if you
	were moved to that tile by an SAO or SUB card. Worked with Mike
	to resolve build logic bugs.
10:45 - began work with applying text when you have to pay someone else
	for their property tile
11:00 - wrote up my time log. Time to go see Iron Man 3! I'll be back.

TOTAL TIME - 52 hours

3:30 - I'm back. Walked into lab
4:00 - updated functions in Tile, prints across the top the cost of
	landing on another player's tile
4:45 - Tweaked functionality of railroad and utility to make their payment
	functions a bit better. Also did some more display work
5:00 - Did some play through. Time for sleep.
